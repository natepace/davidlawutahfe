However, <a href="/web/20201001041325/https://www.pacelawutah.com/Family-Law/Child-Support.shtml">child support</a> can be modified every three years if there is a significant change in income from one parent. Also, as children get older, <a href="/web/20201001041325/https://www.pacelawutah.com/Family-Law/Visitation-Parenting-Time.shtml">visitation</a> and parenting time plans can be modified if the child requests it and if it is in his or her best interest.</p><h3>Contact Our Salt Lake City Child Custody Modification Attorneys</h3><p>To schedule a free initial consultation, please contact us toll free at <strong>801-355-9700</strong> or through our <a href="/web/20201001041325/https://www.pacelawutah.com/Contact.shtml">online contact form</a>.</p>
